# Modular Sinatra Concept

This is a public version of an experiment and should not be considered
advice or a system to base your own off of. YMMV.

## Problem

Writing a lightweight API endpoint in Sinatra is easy at first, but
can quickly devolve into an unmaintainable mess. Lacking framework
imposed idioms for organization, a Sinatra code base can turn into a
smattering of files confusingly loaded or thousand-line monoliths that
nobody wants to read.

This project is an exploration of a system for organizing such an API
into a coherent and extensible structure that developers can
understand and expand on, providing a little bit of structure that
helps resist creep and confusion.
